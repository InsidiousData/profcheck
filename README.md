# ProfCheck

A lightweight extension to find the instructor name(s) for a course on the University of British Columbia's course explorer, and displays their rating as well as their RMP link directly in the page.

This extension should be fast and up-to-date, as it queries the Rate My Professors database directly.

Support for UBC Vancouver and UBC Okanagan campuses.
