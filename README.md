# ProfCheck

A lightweight extension to find the instructor name(s) for a course on a school's course explorer, and displays their rating as well as their RMP link directly in the page.

This extension is fast and up-to-date, as it queries the Rate My Professors database directly.

- University of British Columbia (Vancouver & Okanagan)
